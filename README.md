# ML_ConvolucionalNN_Cat-Dog_Classification
My solution to FreeCodeCamp "Cat-Dog-Classification" task: "For this challenge, you will complete the code to classify images of dogs and cats. You will use TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time. (Extra credit if you get it to 70% accuracy!)"
